"Medical Cost Analysis" Project Presentation

Introduction
Hello, in this presentation, I will be sharing the details of the "Medical Cost Analysis" project. Our goal in this project was to perform cost estimation using the health insurance dataset.

Data Analysis
To begin with, we examined the dataset. It consists of X rows and Y columns in total. We conducted a thorough analysis of each column to understand their meanings. Specifically, we focused on the distribution of the "bmi" variable and the correlation between "smoking status" and "charges."

Data Preprocessing
During the data preprocessing stage, we checked for missing data and removed them as needed. We employed label encoding and one-hot encoding techniques to convert categorical variables into numerical formats. The data was divided into training and test sets, and scaling was applied to enhance its compatibility with the model.

Model Selection
We experimented with various regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Based on the outcomes of cross-validation, we determined that the Random Forest model delivered the best performance.

Hyperparameter Optimization
Opting for the Random Forest model, which demonstrated the highest performance, we employed the Grid Search technique for hyperparameter optimization. This involved identifying the most suitable parameters and subsequently retraining the model.

Model Evaluation
We evaluated the optimized model using test data. Performance metrics such as R2 score, RMSE, and MAE were utilized to gauge the effectiveness of the model. The results we achieved were notably favorable.

Findings and Comments
The primary objective of this project was to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques for predicting health insurance costs. Our findings indicated that the Random Forest model yielded the most accurate predictions. Moreover, we observed that variables like age, gender, and smoking status could significantly influence the costs.

Conclusion
Throughout the project, we successfully implemented data analysis and machine learning techniques. We are confident that the insights we gained have the potential to contribute to future health insurance cost predictions. I am now open to addressing any questions you may have. Thank you.
