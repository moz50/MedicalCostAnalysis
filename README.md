Medical Cost Analysis Project Presentation
Entrance
Hello, in this presentation I will share the details of the "Medical Cost Analysis" project. In our project, we aimed to make a cost estimation using the health insurance dataset.
Data analysis
First, we examined the dataset. It contains X rows and Y columns in total. We analyzed the data to understand what each column means. In particular, we focused on the distribution of the "bmi" variable and the relationship between "smoker" and "charges".
Data Preprocessing
During the data preprocessing stage, we checked for missing data and removed it when necessary. We used label encoding and one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables to numeric form. We divided the data into training and test data. We also scaled the data to make it more suitable for the model.
Model Selection
We tried different regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. According to the cross-validation results, we determined that the best performance was in the Random Forest model.
Hyper-parameter Optimization
We selected the best performing model, the Random Forest model, and used the Grid Search method for hyper-parameter optimization. We found the best parameters and retrained the model.
Model Evaluation
We evaluated the optimized model on the test data. We measured the performance of the model using metrics such as R2 score, RMSE, MAE. The results we obtained were quite satisfactory.
Results and Comments
This project aimed to use data analysis and machine learning techniques to estimate health insurance costs. We found that the model performed best in the Random Forest. We observed that factors such as age, gender and smoking status may affect the cost.
Conclusion
We successfully applied data analysis and machine learning techniques while completing the project. Our results may contribute to future health insurance cost estimates.


Hello, esteemed participants, Today, I am pleased to present to you the "Medical Cost Analysis" project. 
This project aimed to predict medical insurance costs using data analysis and machine learning techniques. Let's go through the project step by step and look at the results and insights together. 
Data Analysis: In the first step, we examined the dataset, which contains X rows and Y columns. We carefully analyzed the meaning of each column. Specifically, we explored the distribution of the "bmi" variable and evaluated the relationship between "smoking status" and "charges".
Data Preprocessing: During data preprocessing, we checked for missing data and removed them where necessary. We transformed categorical variables into numerical forms using label encoding and one-hot encoding. We split the data into training and test sets and scaled it to enhance model suitability. 
Model Selection: We experimented with different regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Based on cross-validation results, we found that the Random Forest model yielded the best performance. 
Hyper-parameter Optimization: Opting for the best-performing Random Forest model, we employed the Grid Search method for hyper-parameter optimization. We identified the optimal parameters and retrained the model. 
Model Evaluation: We assessed the optimized model on the test data. Using metrics such as R2 score, RMSE, and MAE, we quantified the model's performance. The outcomes we achieved were highly satisfactory. Results and Insights: This project aimed to utilize data analysis and machine learning techniques for predicting medical insurance costs. We identified that the Random Forest model delivered the optimal results. We observed that variables like age, gender, and smoking status could impact costs. In conclusion, we successfully applied data analysis and machine learning techniques throughout the project. We believe that the results we obtained hold the potential to contribute to future predictions of medical insurance costs. I am now open to any questions you may have. Thank you.
